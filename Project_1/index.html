            devsForFun(❤️): day 4
        </h1>  
        <p>welcome to day4!</p>
        <p>in today’s, we’ll be going through a little bit of html & css after which you’ll be challenged to create a few things on <a href="https://codepen.io/">codepen.io</a></p>
        <p>you don’t have to watch day 3 session. this notes will get you up better than the video does. time is precious. i respect yours, therefore this advice.</p>
        <p>you don’t have to submit the update for this in a single day, please take your time. the exercise will help you remember and get used to things that matter in HTML (you’ll still have a lot to learn tho!).</p>
        <p>and, this note is purposefully made long and time-consuming to make sure you explore and learn about various things, on your own (learning on your own is more important than any other skill, to become a programmer or a developer)</p>
        <p>if you want to remember these things, i strongly suggest you come back to this note a second time, around 3 days after you finish it for the first time.</p>
        <p>before you continue, please sign up on codepen and then proceed with the practice. otherwise, you won’t be able to save your work.</p>
        <br>
        <p>qoute of the day:</p>
        <em>“tell me and i forget, teach me and i remember, invlove me and i learn” - benjamin franklin</em>
        <br>
        <p>let's talk some tech now.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>here's what you’ll be learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>a little about HTML</li>
            <li>heading tags</li>
            <li>paragraph tag and <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag</li>
            <li>links & images</li>
            <li>lists</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>A little about HTML</h3>
        <p><strong>HTML: </strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</p>
        <p><strong>Hyper Text: </strong>text that links to other documents</p>
        <p><strong>Markup Language: </strong>a language to mark things!</p>

        <h3>Heading Tags</h3>
        <p>We have 6 types/sizes of headings in HTML. They are:</p>
        <div class="images">
            <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2F60280c64-1186-4fdb-8a4a-ccac97405cd8%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=27d78108-c2de-472e-ab24-120965b5fd7d&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=1890&userId=&cache=v2" alt="heading tags">
        </div>

        <p>As you may have already noticed, each of them is of different size, indicating different levels of heading, just like in a book (like the Book’s name, chapter’s name, topic name, and so on).</p>
        <p>Here, <code>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</code> is called a tag. <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is called the <strong>opening tag</strong> and &lt;/h1&gt; is called the <strong>closing tag</strong>.</p>

        <p>And, all of <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;</code> is called an <strong>element</strong>. Why do you have to learn what it’s called</p>
        <p>They help you communicate your ideas/doubts with others, and for googling. knowing the terms will help you clearly describe the problem you have and thus, easily find a solution for it.</p>

        <h3>Paragraph tag & other text formatting text </h3>
        <p>A paragraph tag is usually used to create a paragraph.</p>
        <p>It looks like this: <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
        <p>Here’s how it would look like if you used it:</p>
        <div class="images">
            <img src="https://devsforfun.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fprod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbe05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f%2F47e24238-403a-4a5f-a0ac-04bfe28ea317%2FUntitled.png?table=block&id=0e7eb617-d063-40f4-9e54-8d1814570008&spaceId=be05161a-71c5-47a4-8aad-b71764c4776f&width=1890&userId=&cache=v2" alt="paragraph tag">
        </div>
        
    </main>
   
</body>
